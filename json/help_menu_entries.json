        "INFO": "**1.** Always remember to delete a game after it's finished or once you don't plan on continuing it; server memory is not free.\n\n**2.** Hosting a private game for you and your friends is completely fine. That said, we encourage you to try to be inclusive and ask around if anyone wants to join."

        "INFO": "To host a Dominions 5/6 game, follow the steps below:\n\n**1.** Use the `/capacity` command to check the available servers and how many free slots each has.\n\n**2.** Visit https://mrclockwork.net, then go to 'Dashboard'. You will have to log into your Discord account, and then you can select one of the 'Host Dominions' options on the side pannel. Fill in all the options (note servers are largely equivalent, so the only criterion to determine which one to pick should be the number of available slots).\n\n**3.** Once you've submitted the game options, the bot will have created a channel with your game name in the corresponding category in the Discord guild that you selected, as well as a role for the players of the game. At this point, you can also connect to your game through the Dominions client using the provided IP and port.\n\n**5.** Players can assign themselves the game's role by using the `/subscribe` command. Claiming a pretender should also automatically assign the role to the player.\n\n**6.** When pretenders are ready, simply use the `/start` command in your game's channel, and the bot will start the game. Note that generating the game can take a significant amount of time, depending on the map size and players and how busy the server is (close to an hour, in the worst cases), so give it time."

        "ENTRY": "How do I claim a pretender I have submitted?",
        "INFO": "After submitting a pretender in-game, type in the `/claim` command followed by your pretender's nation name. Note that claiming a pretender is no longer a requirement to start a game, and doing so simply provides access to some advanced functionality like player preferences which allow one to receive backups of new turns, turn reminders, etc."

        "INFO": "A blitz is a Dominions 5/6 game that is meant to be more compact and resolved in one sitting. As such, it normally has no turn timer (or a short timer, like 10 minutes), and things like new turn notifications are not needed. The process to host a blitz is exactly the same as that of hosting a regular game. Simply tweak the settings to your liking."

        "INFO": "This used to be supported, but the best way to do this now is to simply host a game with placeholder settings, so as to have a channel created. Once the settings are discussed and decided, just use the /settings command to change the game's settings before starting the game."

        "INFO": "The first thing you should do is use the `/maps` or `/mods` commands, to make sure the map or mod is not already available in the server on which you are planning to host your game. If it isn't, then follow the steps below:\n\n**1.** Locate all the map or mod files in question on your computer, and compress them all into a single .zip file. Only the .zip format is accepted! Make sure you zip them up directly as they are contained in the `maps` or `mods` folder. *Do not* zip a folder containing the files.\n\n**2.** Upload that zipped file to your Google Drive.\n\n**3.** In Google Drive, right click your zipped file, and click on 'Get link'. Make sure the link is *public*.\n\n**4.** Copy your shareable link.\n\n**5.** On a Discord guild where the bot is deployed, type in the command `/upload`, followed by the game for which you're uploading (Dominions 5 or 6), as well as the shareable link you copied.\n\n**6.** The bot will start downloading your file and will notify you when it's finished. Note that already existing files will *not* be overwritten, so as to prevent an upload causing problems to an ongoing game."
